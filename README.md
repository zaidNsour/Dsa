 # Java Data Structures and Algorithms Library

A comprehensive library of commonly used data structures and algorithms implemented in Java.
This library is designed to provide a set of reusable components for developers working on Java projects.

## Features

- **Data Structures:**
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree)
  - Graphs(Directed Graph, UnDirected Graph, Flow Graph)
  - Hash Tables
  - Heap
  - and more...

- **Algorithms:**
  - Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, QuickSort, etc.)
  - Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
  - Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Max Flow Algorithms
  - String Algorithms
  - and more...
